# Phantasy Star Online - High Definition
A High Definition Texture Pack for the Gamecube version of Phantasy Star Online.

This is a texture pack for the Gamecube version of Phantasy Star Online made to work on the Dolphin emulator. Textures were dumped with Dolphin's texture dumping feature as well as Venomalia's DolphinTextureExtraction-tool, and upscaled with the HDcube 3 ESRGAN model.

# Notes on the current state of the Texture Pack #

Current version has textures for all of episode 1 and episode 2.

Some special weapons and class-specific stuff like the tekkers aren't all upscaled yet, and also most Ultimate enemies variants, see below for how to help.

Unfortunately, the game's text doesn't seem to be upscalable, and would likely require a ISO patch.

FMVs aren't included since they take a large amount of storage space (about 16gigs) due to being stored as individual frames rather than a normal video file. If you know any workarounds for this, feel free to contact me.


# How to Help #

You can give me feedback by contacting me on discord (@lucaspec72#9705), things like non-upscaled textures or anything of note.

If you want to help with dumping any stray textures i missed, you can enable texture dumping while running the texture pack, dolphin will only dump textures not yet present in it. then you can send them to me so that i can upscale them and include them in the Texture Pack.

For items specifically, you can contact me so we get in the same game session to manually dump them myself if you don't know/want to dump textures yourself.
